## Summary

The scrip can be used to tabulate election data when provided in a .csv format. As the script is curently writen so the winner of an election can be calculated along with the couty with the most votes. The script could be modified if more fields were added to .csv to get addtional voting statistics. For example, a ethinicty column could be added and the script could be modified to provide an output showing this statistic. The scrip could also be altered to validate ballots proir to counting to ensure the .csv file contains only counties relavant to the presinct.
